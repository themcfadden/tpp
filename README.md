Telepresence Puppet
===================

Project Description
-------------------
This bit of code is supposed to allow one to remotely control a computer
with a camera and some motors. Let's see how it turns out!

It uses the incredible https://webrtc.org/ and the https://github.com/priologic/easyrtc
Javascript libaries to make it all happen.

Major inspiration and ideas came from:
  * William Cooley's video https://youtu.be/rtgysHYEnNo
  * ArchReactors telebotv2 https://github.com/ArchReactor/telebotv2
