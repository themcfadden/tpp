Telepresence Puppet
===================

Project Description
-------------------
This bit of code is supposed to allow one to remotely control a computer
with a camera and some motors. Let's see how it turns out!

It uses the incredible https://webrtc.org/ and the https://github.com/priologic/easyrtc
Javascript libaries to make it all happen.

Major inspiration and ideas came from:
  * William Cooley's video https://youtu.be/rtgysHYEnNo
  * ArchReactors telebotv2 https://github.com/ArchReactor/telebotv2

Software Environment Setup Notes

#### 1. Install NodeJS, v6
  * Linux:
    * curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
    * sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
    * check with node -v. Should say v6.10.0 or greater
  * Windows:

#### 2. Clone EasyRTC
  * git clone git@github.com:priologic/easyrtc.git
#### 3. Change directory to easyRTC, and follow their installation instructions

#### 4. Create self signed key and certs
  * In the directory tpp/server, create a key and cert.
